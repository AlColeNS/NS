# File Share Crawler Start List
#
# Note: Unlike the 'crawl_follow.txt' and 'crawl_ignore.txt' files
#       where file paths are normalized to the Linux format of
#       forward slashes, this configuration file expects the path
#       names to be formatted based on how the OS refers to them.
#
#       Windows Examples:
#
#       \\FileShare\Folder1\Folder2
#       C:\FileShare\Folder1\Folder2
#
#       Linux Examples:
#
#       /FileShare/Folder1/Folder2
#
/Users/acole/NS
