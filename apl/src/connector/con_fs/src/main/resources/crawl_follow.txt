#
# Note: If you are attempting to follow folder\file combinations on the
#       Windows platform, then you must convert all backslash characters
#       to forward slashes.  This is due to the fact that each line in
#       can be expressed as a regular expression.
#
#       If you are processing the following Windows paths:
#
#       \\FileShare\Folder1\Folder2
#       C:\FileShare\Folder1\Folder2
#
#       You should format them as follows:
#
#       //FileShare/Folder1/Folder2
#       C:/FileShare/Folder1/Folder2
#
/
